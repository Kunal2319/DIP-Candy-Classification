### ❗ Project Execution Steps:
1. Candy Image Dataset Creation: Collect and create your own dataset of candy images.
2. Candy Classification by Features: Organize the dataset by candy features.
3. Adjust Image Dimensions (W x H): Resize images to consistent width and height.
4. Data Annotation: Use CVAT for labeling and annotating the dataset.
5. Data Augmentation: Apply techniques to increase the variety of images in the dataset.
6. Image Filtering Functions: Implement functions to filter and preprocess images.
7. Data Normalization: Normalize image data to improve model performance.
8. Image Segmentation: Segment images to isolate regions of interest.
9. Classification: Test various methods, including CNNs and other algorithms, for candy classification.
10. Results Evaluation: Analyze the performance and accuracy of the classification models.
